# UnTube
Hides YouTube's ads and addictive suggestions

![untube](http://www.cattaneo.uy/public/untube-1.png)

Here are a bunch of random hypothetical situations:

* You start watching a video of your favorite band, but end up learning about electrolytic baths or the guinea pigs mating season in summer.
* You've watched way too many pimple popping videos.

Does any of the latter sound familiar? that's because you're unable to watch just one (1) video. Pretty much like smokers and cigarrettes, or alcoholics and booze.
Following the latter analogy regarding an alcoholic, think of this add-on as your free and personal AA.

**This add-on hides**:
* Ads, including that annoying "Skip in..." b#stard.
* Addictive YouTube suggestions, both on videos and on the right sidebar. You can toggle them back though, using the top-right UnTube icon.
